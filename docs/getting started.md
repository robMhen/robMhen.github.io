# Getting Started
<br>
## Overview
This guide walks through the process of getting started with the password manager [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). At the end of this guide, users will have installed the Bitwarden extension in a supported browser, created an account, added login credentials to their vault, generated a secure password, and used the autofill feature.
<br>
## Installing Bitwarden

Bitwarden is available to install as a desktop application, browser extension, and mobile app. Bitwarden browser extensions are supported for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Brave, Opera, Tor, and Vivaldi. Download the Bitwarden browser extension from your browser's app store or marketplace, or from the [Bitwarden Downloads](https://bitwarden.com/download/) page.

Browser requirements and detailed instructions for installing Bitwarden can be found in the [Installation Guide](installation.md).

    Your master password cannot be recovered if forgotten, so it should be something secure but also easy to remember.
