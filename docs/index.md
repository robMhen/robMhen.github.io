# Welcome to my portfolio

Hi, I'm Robyn. I am a Technical Writer with 2-3 years of experience creating documents for clients in the Federal Government. This site includes a copy of my resume and some brief samples of my writing. I enjoy learning new products and skills, and using my knowledge and communication skills to help others accomplish their goals.
